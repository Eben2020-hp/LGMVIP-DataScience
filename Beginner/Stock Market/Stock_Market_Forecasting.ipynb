If we are trying to predict the last word in “the clouds are in the sky,” we don’t need any further context – it’s pretty obvious the next word is going to be sky. In such cases, where the gap between the relevant information and the place that it’s needed is small, RNNs can learn to use the past information.\n",

It’s entirely possible for the gap between the relevant information and the point where it is needed to become very large.\n",
